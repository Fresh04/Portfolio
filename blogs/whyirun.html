        I started running in <strong>May</strong> during summer break of college. Sixth Semester of College was done. I had no internship for the summer. I was about ~<strong>100&nbsp;kgs</strong>, and didn't feel good with myself —
        so I laced up. I started Running. It was hard at first. Couldn't run even 1km in a go. But ran every every day. My first 5km took about an hour and felt like a marathon. 25 straight days of running daily, my stamina grew. 
        I could now run 5km without stopping and in about 35 minutes now. Lost about 7-8 kgs in the process. Now it wasn't just about health. A day without running felt sore. Felt like something was off. I started to enjoy the runs.
      </p>

        Kudos from Strava gave me a never before seen hits. Simply Running wasn't an option anymore. I started setting goals for PR times and distances. First sub 5 1K, first sub 30 5k. Somewhere in there I fell into a 
        <strong>Casey Neistat</strong> rabbit hole. His love for running is infectious — the shots, the city, the grit. That energy kept me going. I would watch his videos of he broke the running barriers even after being in a life changing 
        accident. His NYC marathon videos are a must watch.

        Mid-June I got an onsite internship at <strong>Programming Pathshala</strong>. Running paused, but I stayed active: squats, push-ups, walking, and a calorie deficit. I'd watched <strong>Ryan Trahan</strong> for a while — didn't realize he was a D1 athelete. 
        His running videos quietly raised the bar for me. His videos are genuinely so wholesome and engaging. Bro is living the life. 

      <blockquote>
        At the start of May I couldn't do one perfect push-up. By August, I could do twenty.

        My internship ended on <strong>July 31</strong>. Back at college I started running again and began beating my PBs. College is busy but I try to find some time for running. Weight dropped to <strong>84&nbsp;kgs</strong>. I ran an unofficial <strong>half-marathon</strong>, 
        then joined the <strong>Red Run 12K</strong> (CG Govt × NSS). Community miles hit different.

        <strong>Current goal:</strong> Train for a <strong>full marathon</strong> — aiming for the TGCG Marathon on <strong>7th Dec</strong>.
        The goal is too hard but where is the fun in achieving small goals.

      <h2>Why I'm Sticking With It</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Simple rules, honest feedback.</strong> You either ran or you didn't.</li>
        <li><strong>Mental clarity.</strong> Best ideas show up after kilometer five and it brings down a lot of mental pressure.</li>
        <li><strong>Identity shift.</strong> “Why not lose weight when you can?” turned into “Why not run when you can?”</li>
      </ul>
