        I started running in <strong>May</strong> during summer break of college. My sixth semester was done. 
        I had no internship lined up for the summer. I was around <strong>100&nbsp;kgs</strong> and didn't feel good about myself —
        so I laced up and started running. It was brutal at first. I couldn't even run 1km without stopping. But I ran every day. 
        My first 5km took about an hour and felt like a marathon. After 25 straight days of running daily, my stamina grew. 
        I could now run 5km without stopping, and in about 35 minutes. Lost about 7-8 kgs in the process. 
        Somewhere during this, I discovered Strava. It became my new favorite app. Connect with me on 
        <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/164347921" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" 
          style="color:#fc5200; font-weight:600; text-decoration:none;">
          Strava here
        </a>. 
        Now it wasn't just about health anymore. A day without running felt wrong. Rest days felt off. I started to genuinely enjoy the runs.
      </p>

      <p>
        The transformation wasn't just physical. Running became my anchor. Early mornings before college, late evenings after classes — I'd find time. 
        Sometimes it was 5K, sometimes just a quick 2K to clear my head. The consistency mattered more than the distance. 
        Every upload to Strava felt like a small win, a proof that I showed up. The routine was building something deeper than fitness.
      </p>

      <p>
        Kudos from Strava gave me dopamine hits like never before. I started setting goals for PR times and distances. First sub-5-minute kilometer, first sub-30-minute 5K. Somewhere in there I fell into a 
        <strong>Casey Neistat</strong> rabbit hole. His love for running is infectious — the shots, the city, the grit. That energy kept me going. I watched his videos where he broke through running barriers even after a life-changing 
        accident. His NYC marathon videos are a must-watch. They showed me that running isn't just exercise — it's a way to push boundaries and tell stories.
      </p>

        Mid-June I got an onsite internship at <strong>Programming Pathshala</strong>. Running paused, but I stayed active: squats, push-ups, walking, and maintaining a calorie deficit. I'd been watching <strong>Ryan Trahan</strong> for a while — didn't realize he was a D1 athlete. 
        His running videos quietly raised the bar for me. His content is genuinely wholesome and engaging. Bro is living the life. 
        The internship was intense — long coding sessions, new frameworks, debugging until late nights. But those bodyweight exercises kept me sane. 
        They were my reset button between work sprints.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        At the start of May I couldn't do one proper push-up. By August, I could do twenty.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        My internship ended on <strong>July 31</strong>. Back at college I started running again and began beating my personal bests. College keeps me busy but I try to find time for running. My weight dropped to <strong>84&nbsp;kgs</strong>. I ran an unofficial <strong>half-marathon</strong>, 
        then ran the <strong>Red Run 12K</strong> (CG Govt x NSS). Community miles hit different. 
        Running with others, the shared exhaustion, the collective push through the last kilometer — it reminded me why races exist. 
        It's not just about the time on the clock. It's about the energy in the crowd, the strangers cheering you on, the finish line that feels earned.
      </p>

      <div class="callout">
        <strong>Current goal:</strong> Train for a <strong>full marathon</strong> — aiming for the TGCG Marathon on <strong>7th Dec</strong>.
        The goal is ambitious but where's the fun in chasing small goals? I'm following a training plan, logging miles, and honestly a bit terrified. 
        But that's the point. The uncertainty makes it real.
      </div>

      <p>
        I've started tracking all my runs and activities on this website now. Added a dedicated 
        <a href="${BASE}blogs.html" style="color:#fc5200; font-weight:600; text-decoration:none;">activity section</a> 
        where I post updates, reflections, and running logs. It's my way of staying accountable and sharing the journey. 
        If you're into running, fitness, or just starting out — check it out. Maybe we'll inspire each other.

      <h2>What Running Taught Me</h2>
      
      <p>
        Running doesn't lie. You can't fake a 10K. You can't negotiate with fatigue at kilometer eight. The clock doesn't care about your excuses. 
        That honesty is brutal but freeing. In a world where everything feels complicated, running is simple. You move forward or you don't.
      </p>

      <p>
        It taught me that starting is always the hardest part. The first kilometer of every run feels terrible. Your legs are heavy, your breathing is off, 
        you question why you're doing this. But somewhere around kilometer two, things click. Your rhythm finds you. The discomfort becomes familiar. 
        You realize you're capable of more than you thought. That lesson applies to everything — coding projects, tough conversations, life decisions. 
        Just start. The momentum will find you.
      </p>

      <p>
        The best part? Running gave me back control. Control over my health, my time, my headspace. When college stress peaks or when I'm stuck on a bug, 
        I run. Twenty minutes later, I'm calmer. Problems feel smaller. Solutions appear. It's become my therapy, my meditation, my way of processing the world.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm not chasing perfection. Some days I run slow. Some days I skip. Some days I only manage 5K when I planned 10K. 
        But I keep showing up. That's the real win. Not the pace, not the distance — just the fact that I'm still lacing up.
      </p>
